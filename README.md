## Etherboard

An experiment with smart contracts and the web3 javascript library.

After deploying the contract, configure settings.json with the address.

Run as a meteor app.

Not fully polished, but was functional on local testrpc.

Contract: ```/private/contract.sol```

Main page: ```/imports/pages/HomePage.jsx```
